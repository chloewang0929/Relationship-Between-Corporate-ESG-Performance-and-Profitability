As global extreme weather events become more frequent and political situations remain unstable, companies are facing unprecedented operational challenges, with supply chain disruption risks increasingly growing. To address these challenges, more and more countries are responding to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) issues and establishing related regulations. For instance, the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will officially begin levying carbon tariffs on January 1, 2026; Taiwan requires listed and over-the-counter companies to prepare sustainability reports and declare carbon fees starting in 2025. Under such trends, corporate sustainability performance is no longer just a future vision but a critical factor directly impacting operational performance.

Moreover, sustainable investing has become a significant trend in capital markets. ETFs using sustainability as a stock selection indicator are showing notable performance. According to Bloomberg data, from October 2013 onwards, the "Emerging Markets Sustainable" and "Asia-Pacific Sustainable" indices have recorded approximately 13.54% and 4.62% excess returns, respectively, compared to the "Emerging Markets Stock" and "Asia-Pacific Stock" indices.

As sustainability issues increasingly gain attention, the correlation between corporate sustainability performance and stock price performance is gradually drawing focus. Many investors have incorporated ESG scores into their stock selection criteria, believing these can influence investment returns. Therefore, this report will explore whether corporate sustainability performance truly impacts company stock prices.
